//* Structure is a collection of data fields with predefined types
//that can define you own data type, which is similar to a class in java.

//* All data fields in a structure can be expressed using a predefined type.

//* Structures further enhance the modularity of our application and help define the
//structure of complex objects. They can be sent to tasks or used in other ways

//Declaring a struct
//	Structures are declared using both the type declaration before the real name
//	and the structural declaration after the name.
//	The struct contains multiple fields with their defined datatype.

package main

// Declaring a Struct
type Person struct {
	name string
	age  int
}

func main() {
}
